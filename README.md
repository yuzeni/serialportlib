# Serialportlib

Incomplete serial-port communication library for Linux.

# Getting Started with Julia

1. `git clone https://github.com/yuzeni/serialportlib.git`
2. `cd serialplotlib`
3. `./build_shared_lib.sh`

Now you should be able to include the file `serialplotlib.jl` from anywhere and use the library.  
For even more convenience you can include the file directly in your `startup.jl`.
