# Serialportlib

Incomplete serial-port communication library for Linux.

## Getting Started with Julia

1. `git clone https://github.com/yuzeni/serialportlib.git`
2. `juila`
3. `julia> include("./serialportlib/serialportlib.jl")`

The library is built automatically using GCC (g++) when its not found in the directory.  
For even more convenience you can include `serialportlib.jl` directly in your `startup.jl`.
